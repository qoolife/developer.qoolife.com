# Replying to a Conversation

You can reply to an existing conversation submitting its data to:

<pre>

</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>post[body]</dt>
	<dd>I say your message</dd>
</dl>

The response will be a JSON response containing the conversation and including an array of posts for each individual conversation, including the posted one, and an array of conversation watchers.

<pre class="console">
curl -u 'user@example.com:sekret' -X POST -d "post[body]=I say your message" https://qoolife.com/api/v1/conversations/1/posts
</pre>
